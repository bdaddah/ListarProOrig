# Support Policy
We provide support exclusively via our support ticket system, and response times may vary (up to 24 hours on weekdays and up to 48 hours during weekends and public holidays).

We provide live chat assistance to answer any questions before purchasing. However, please note that we do not offer technical support.

All our paid extensions/themes come with an annual license that allows you to use the licensed extension for one year, and you are qualified to receive technical support throughout the year. You must renew your license to continue receiving our support. Our paid support includes the following:

## Bug Fixing.
Issues regarding the plugin/extension functionality.
Usage Guidelines and Suggestions.
We provide general support to our free users, including bug fixing.
[N.B: We do not support products containing copyright infringements, promoting violence, racism, adult content, gambling, alcohol, music, vulgarity, or explicit materials.]

## The item support period
A supported item includes item support for 6 months from the purchase date. During those 6 months, the author is expected to be available to provide the item support services we’ve set out on this page. Response times by authors can vary depending on the volume of inquiries, the nature of the request, and whether questions have already been answered or support has already been provided (see ‘fair-use’ later on).

If you’re about to purchase the item, you’ll have the option to purchase extended item support, increasing the item support period up to a maximum of 12 months from the date of purchase.

## Our Support Does Not Cover
We provide support exclusively through our ticketing system and do not offer assistance via live chat, phone calls, or social networks.

We reserve the right to decline any request for customization services.

We reserve the right to refuse the integration of any third-party services.

It is important to note that we will never ask for any of your site details or personal contact information via private or unofficial email. Please do not provide any confidential information through these channels, as we are not responsible for any negative consequences that may arise.
